    " To prepare for this project, it will be necessary to collect data from reliable resources. All of Amtrak's information is collected and published online for all to access. The data collected for this project won't only be information from Amtrak, but also data collected about automotive travel, metro transit, daily commutes, as well as demand for transit via polls from citizens. To process this data, it will be important to be able to filter through the information in order to be able to select data that truly explains and solves the argument for efficient public transit. It will also be important to compare databases in order to find contradictions to determine the fallibility of the data and find the margin of error. Once the correct data has been selected and proven to be trusted information, we can finally analyze the data collected to determine if public transit could truly make commute faster and safer, or if the cost would outway the possibly minute difference. To share this information once analyzed, there must be important attractive visuals and concise descriptions applied to the subject matter. There must be a well-worded recap of how the data was collected and refined, followed by our results. When the final project is published, the project can finally be published to the appropriate sites and organizations.\n",

    " The first dataset will analyze the current riderships of Amtrak throughout the country. We will see which regions of the country suffer from low ridership and try to analyze why. \n",
    "\n",
    " The second dataset will analyze the past of Amtrak to see where and when they began to lose ridership. \n",
    "\n",
    " The third dataset will analyze the correlation of ridership along with average trip durations of specific areas. "
